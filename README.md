# Image Transformer

---

Implementation of Image Transformer from [Image Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05751).

An auto-regressive, generative architecture using Transformer architecture in the image domain.

Ideally replaces architectures such as PixelCNN and PixelRNN.

Not to be confused with Vision Transformer.
